    <h2>What is Secret Santa NZ?</h2>
    <p>Secret Santa NZ is the Bluesky version of the game, continuing in the tradition
      of NZ Twitter Secret Santa. At Christmas and Mid-Winter, Kikorangi/Bluesky Aotearoa,
      play a giant game of Secret Santa.</p>
    <p>Just like Secret Santa in your office or book club, you anonymously buy a present for
      someone and in turn you receive a present from your own anonymous Secret Santa.
      The joy of Secret Santa is in sleuthing your Giftee, finding the perfect gift, and then
      watching with child-like glee and a full heart as they receive, then open their present
      and the post the experience on the <a
      href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/<%= settings.hashtag.substring(1) %>"
      target="_blank"
      ><%= settings.hashtag %></a
    > hashtag.</p>
    <p>>Whether you play or watch from the sidelines, Secret Santa NZ brings a true joy that
      we need in this world.</p>

    <h2>Are you the same as Twitter Secret Santa?</h2>
    <p>The most recent incarnation of the game, yes.</p>
    <p><a href="https://websam.nz/">WebSam</a> started the NZ Twitter Secret Santa in 2010 and ran it for 3 years.
      After that he handed it over to <a href="https://www.nzpost.co.nz/">NZ Post</a> who ran it until 2018.</p>
    <p>Foxy and the crew picked up the baton in 2019 and ran <a href="https://twitter.com/SecretSantaNZ">@SecretSantaNZ</a>
      until 2022.</p>
    <p>Since most of us moved to Bluesky we're getting the band back together to carry on this Christmassy tradition.</p>
